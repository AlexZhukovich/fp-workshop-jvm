/*
  Create a class that can represents a one argument function from Integer to Integer.

  Express the function y = x + 1 with your class.
  Express the function y = (x + 2)^2 with your class.
  Express the function y = -x + 100 with you class.

  Expressing only simple Integer to Integer functions does not look very powerful
  and useful can this Function definition be enhanced to work on any type?
