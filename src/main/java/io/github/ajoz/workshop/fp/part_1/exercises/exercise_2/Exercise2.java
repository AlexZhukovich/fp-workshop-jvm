/*
  -- Advanced Functions --

  Create a class that can represents a one argument function from a generic type
  A to a generic type B

  - part 1:
  Express the function from String to String that is adding word "foo" to every
  argument. Use it to concatenate: "bar", "baz", "qux"

  - part 2:
  Use the new Function type to express the functions from the first exercise:
  1) y = x + 1
  2) y = (x + 2)^2
  3) y = -x + 10

  - part 3:
  Create functions:
  1) f that takes a String and converts it to an Integer
  2) g that takes an Integer and converts it to a Boolean - true if it is 42, false
     otherwise
  3) h that takes a String and returns a Boolean - h should do what a combination
     of f and g would, you can use f and g to solve this.

  Is there a problem with function f?
  Can we combine f and g in a meaningful way?
