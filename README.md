# Functional Programming workshop with examples in Java/Kotlin

This is a general plan of Functional Programming Workshop (beginner/intermediate level).
All parts of the workshop are planned to take around 3 hours (2 - 2.5h with 2x 15 min break)

## What is expected:
- intermediate knowledge of Java language
- basic knowledge of Kotlin lang (but not necessary)
- basic understanding of Java generics
- no previous knowledge about lambdas and method references is required

## You won't learn:
- RxJava/RxKotlin/Rx* (because rx is not functional, nor is it functional reactive programming - FRP)
- Java 8 API (Stream, NIO - but we will build Stream-like types)
- Kotlin API (Sequence, Iterable extensions)
- Vavr library (although we will discuss and create several tools that the library has to offer)
- Arrow library (the same as in case of Vavr)
- Haskell or any ML variant (although we will look at some examples to compare with Java/Kotlin implementations)

## What is needed:
- at least Open JDK for Java 8 (JDK)
- latest version of Kotlin (1.3)
- Android Studio or Intelij Idea
- latest version of Kotlin plugin
- gradle installed
- GIT (repository with the workshop examples is stored on github)
